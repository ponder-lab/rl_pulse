## TODO

- Debug `Error when checking input: expected lstm_20_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (0, 3)`. Apparently has to do something with `timesteps`, basically need to make sure data is in proper shape.
- Write up stuff in notebook, run, and debug!
- Think about [this](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26366/training-an-rnn-with-examples-of-different-lengths-in-keras). Think about padding state (everything after should be zero anyway...).
- Look at [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series) to figure out padding and time series analysis
